        "Mini Maestro is a game about enjoying music. It is inspired by a toy my mother bought for my first son. I saw how much fun he got out of it: exploring instruments, learning classical songs, and just dancing like a madman. Mini Maestro aspires to deliver this same joy but in a digital form.",
        "This game was created by Brian Mumm and Rob Galanakis. Audio by Person X and art by Person Y. I hope you enjoy playing Mini Maestro as much as we enjoyed making it!"
